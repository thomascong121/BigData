1. Case Management : cognitive augmentation | Data Curation|digital augmentation
	process: interaction among people, services, process and device
	Example: Inquiry process:
		- Hypothesis, questions, planning
		- Information items: inquiry content
		- line of inquiries = tasks
		- brief
	Augmentation: Item tagging| [ for content]
		- content augmentation: knowledge extraction |. Enrichment
		- Natural language: search, conversations
	Augmentation: Interactions with services  [for task]
	cognitive augmentation:
		- Annotation | coding [#comments]
		- Context Capture
		- Intent recogieron
		- Natural language conversation with services [ ChatBots]
	Empower Workers with digital assistants
		- digital assistances through conversations between users and services
	Productivity: everything repetitive which can be replaced by automated task: increase productivity
	Effectiveness: doing the same thing but using a better way

	
	
  2. Example: ChatBots1
  	Tech:
  		- role-based: if the user input match any provided pattern, bot is able to response
  		- flow-based: design conversation flow [no coding required]
  		- machine learning based: predict what user is likely to input

  	flow-based | Characteristics
  		- quick bootstraping
  		- no coding
  		- fast and accurate
  		- could be smart enough, if developer can think of every possible situations
  		- simple

  	flow-based | Characteristics
  		- card: basic building components
  		- text: text card can contain onlt text
  		- quick reply
  		- Gallery/Carousel: allows you to send images
  		- block: contain 1+ message card [container]
